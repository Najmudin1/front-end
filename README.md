#### 6. Intelligent application of Information Architecture and PARC

In the labs and lecture we as a group were recommeded to use navigation architecture, hence why my navigation is so easy to use.
furhthermore i have added a sitemap in my footer so the user expirence is easy and simple for users.
as for PARC, which are the 4 design principle, i have not used all of the in my website but i have used some such as alignment becasue as you can see in my website that everytingh is placed thoughtfully and it is connected the personal profile page.
